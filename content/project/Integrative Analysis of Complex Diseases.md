<p>Recent advances in high throughput technologies and the rapid deluge of gentic/genomic/metabolomic information have accelerated the convergence of discovery science with clinical medicine. Successful translations of large scale data into therapeutics and diagnostics reinforce its potential for personalizing medicine of complex diseases. We study pathogenesis of complese diseases (fatty liver disease) through integrated approaches of systems biology, biochemistry and cell biology, for the purpose of dissecting their molecular mechanisms and developing their translational applications. </p>

By using multi-dimentional data (lipidomics, metabolomics, etc.) derived from different sources, we performed an integrative analysis and developed a powerful non-invastive tool for diagnosis of NASH (Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis).
