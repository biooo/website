The cutting-edge high-throughput technologies (e.g., lipidomics, metabolimics, genomics and genetics) enable us to assess the molecular changes that occur during various biological processes. The research in my lab will focus on computational analysis of 'omics data', in an ongoing effort to find hidden treasures for improving public understanding of the basic mechanism (Kara et al., European Journal of Human Genetics, 2017; Zhou et al., Journal of Hepatology, 2015; Mysore et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta-Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids, 2016).
