We are currently seeking a PhD student to work on the project 'Integrative multi-omic study of progression to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis' (commencing in October 2017), which will be supported by [GW4 MRC BioMed DTP] (http://www.gw4biomed.ac.uk/available-projects/national-productivity-investment-fund-studentships/) for 3.5 years. The student will develop her/his QUANTITATIVE SKILLS in big data analysis and INTERDISCIPLINARY SKILLS in experimental biology and adipose physiology across Cardiff University and University of Exeter. Particularly, the student will work on clinical data and samples of patients after bariatric surgery and develop a translational skill set. Passion towards science is most important and we warmly welcome applications from from various backgrounds without any special requirement.

If you have any concerns please contact us (email: `zhouy58@cardiff.ac.uk`) 

#### Supervisors
Dr. You Zhou (I&I-SIURI, Cardiff University), Dr. Katarina Kos (Medical School, University of Exeter), Prof. Valerie O’Donnell (I&I-SIURI, Cardiff University), Prof. Andrew Godkin (I&I-SIURI, Cardiff University)

### Research Environment: 
Dr. Zhou, Profs. O’Donnell and Godkin are members of the Division of Infection & Immunity (I&I), one of 4 research divisions within Cardiff University School of Medicine that represent its research focus. The Division was recognized by the REF2014 as a major research strength in Cardiff University, as 4* overall. The strength of Cardiff in big data and immunology Research has been recognized through the establishment of the ~£4.5M Systems Immunity University Research Institute (SIURI), of which 3 applicants are members. 
The Adipose Tissue Biology Group (led by Dr. Kos) at the Medical School of University of Exeter is closely interlinked with the NIHR Clinical Research Facility at Wonford.  The school has recently won a Silver Athena SWAN award in recognition of its impact to advancing the representation of women in STEMM subjects. 

### Project Description
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a leading cause of cirrhosis, affects ~5% of the UK population. What determines the progression to NASH is unknown and there is no approved therapy. The student will profile the pathogenesis of NASH using state-of-the-art technologies in systems biology and translational medicine.
