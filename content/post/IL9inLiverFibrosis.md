## Th9/IL-9 in hepatic fibrogenesis
Our study has been highly recommended by [Faculty of 1000] (https://f1000.com/prime/726054174) with a level of ★★ as "New Finding" and "Novel Drug Target" and "Elegant study". We have found that Th9/IL-9 is likely to serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention of hepatic fibrosis. Thus, the findings provide a a promising novel approach to treat liver fibrosis by using Th9/IL9 based immunotherapy.

Prof. Bruno Stieger at University Hospital Zurich said: “This `elegant` combination of research with `patient samples and mice` reveals that a subset of T helper cells, Th9 and Th17 cells, is increased in the plasma of patients with chronic
hepatitis. This increase goes in parallel with elevated interleukin9 (IL9) and IL17 levels, together with additional inflammatory markers. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mouse model of fibrosis, Th9 and Th17 cells were increased in spleen. Treatment of fibrotic mice with IL9 neutralizing antibodies attenuated liver inflammation and fibrosis and to led to a
reduction of Th9, Th17, and Th1 cells in the spleen of these mice. These data suggest that Th9 cells may aggravate hepatic liver fibrosis and that `Th9 cells may be a novel drug target for liver fibrosis`.""
